        <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? <br> 
            Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate.</strong> <br> 
            And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date. </sup> <br> <br> 
            Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
            And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimmed;</sub> <br>
            And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
            By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed; <br> <br> 
            But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
            Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, <br>
            Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, <br>
            When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. <br>
            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. <br>
